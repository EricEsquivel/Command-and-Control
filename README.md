# Command-and-Control
# This is my next project a command and control server.
# The server uses threading to talk to multiple clients at the same time (this has only been tested locally not across the internet)
# MAKE SURE TO ADD THE IP FOR THE SERVER ON BOTH THE SERVER AND CLIENT FILE!
# I added my 'budgetportscanner' project into this and modified it a little to better fit the server and client file.
# Future plans: Client runs keylogger when server commands it, client grabs geolocation of pc and sends to server
