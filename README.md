# Command-and-Control Latest: v1.2.0
# This is my next project a command and control server.
# The server uses sockets and threading to talk to multiple clients at the same time
# I added my 'budgetportscanner' project into this and modified it a little to better fit the server and client file.
# New things with v1.2.0: Just added args real quick to run this instead of having to edit the file
# Future plans: Using argparse, Client runs keylogger when server commands it, client grabs geolocation of pc and sends to server
